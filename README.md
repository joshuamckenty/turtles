=======

Turtles is an installer for microbosh and cloudfoundry on OpenStack.
It's being converted to match the new CloudFoundry bootstrap approach.


TODO:
=====

Change screen shot of keypairs to new interface.
Get ubuntu image from somewhere: 
http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/release/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img

Set up security group to allow SSH and all the relevant ports.

BUG: Images panel should auto-refresh after uploading.
BUG: Bad glance URL for upload should fail with a message.

Stemcell image needs GC agent injected?

wget â€“q j.mp/turtles-inception -O - | sudo bash

Update screenshot of getting keystone API endpoint.
cloud_ext key should be explained better.

Take out downgrading of bosh_cpi_openstack step.
